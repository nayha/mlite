# How to set up

  - Create a virtual host if you are setting up on your local machine.
  - Check out the project (files) from the repository
  - Create a database and import db.sql which can be found right under the root folder
  - Duplicate `constants.php.example` and rename to `constants.php`.
  - Open `constants.php` and modify necessary values such as Database settings and API_KEY.
  - That is all and you can now open it in your browser.
